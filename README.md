# Project Description

Here is a summary of the projects context:
1. Customer Segmentation — Kira Plastina, an online clothing shop in Russia sells ready-to-wear designer clothes. The Kira Plastina brand targets young girls from the age of 18-25 years and older. We have data collected by Kira Plastina for a year and are tasked with doing analysis to find out the characteristics of customer groups that visit Kira Plastina website. In this project, we will employ K-Means and Hierachical clustering to find out the traits of customers who visit Kira Plastina website. 

2. Advertisement analysis — A Kenyan entrepreneur, who has previously ran a course advertisement on her blog would like to know: which kinds of individuals are more likely to click on her advertisements. From the initial advertisement, the entrepreneur was able to collect some data and would like a Data Science Consultant to analyze the given data and report recommendations. The findings from the analysis will be crucial in determining which kinds of individuals to target before running another advertisement. In this project, we will apply supervised machine learning with R to understand what kinds of individuals are likely to click on an ad in her blog.
